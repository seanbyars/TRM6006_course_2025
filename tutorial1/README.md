- This is the R Markdown code (TRM tutorial 1.Rmd) and the html from the first tutorial.
- Here we covered:
  - an Introduction to R, which partly followed the Monash Bioinformatics Platform 'Introduction to R' workshop (https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-intro-2/)
  - Survival analyses in R, using an online tutorial, but mainly focussing on data downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) portal
  
- The R Markdown code can be viewed here in github.
- If you want to view the html from today's tutorial, you can:
  - 1. download the .html file from github and view locally on your laptop or
  - 2. view online with the link that I'll post in Moodle.
